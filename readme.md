step to start the code...

IF YOU WANT TO TRAIN BY YOURSELF
1. First download the IAM dataset from it's website unzip it
2. Then create the create a folder named "data" in the root directory (same location as handwritten_recognition.ipynb) which will contain two things{"word.txt" and "word" folder} 
3. "word.txt" which will have correct label of photos that are present in word folder.
4. Now start running the handwritten__ipynb file for training your model


IF YOU WANT TO USE PRE TRAINED MODEL
1.Just run the main.html file in "serverfile" folder 
2. Page will open at your localhost , Give input image to the input you will get output


Remark  : input image should be of high contrast and clear , also accuracy of model is only 72% so don't expect correct result everytime.
